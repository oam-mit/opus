  This is a story of good and evil, of loyalty and friendship.   

It is not correct to say that Yaksha was always a murderous psychopath, but the battleline between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, and that line was crossed due to the circumstances, and then there was no return. Another surprising element in the story is Professor Ankit. His role is arguable. Though pretended to be a well-meaning member of the faculty, he was loyal and honest to the one he swore his allegiance to, i.e., Yaksha. Harsh is just a seventeen-year-old boy, but as we all know, maturity is not measured by age; it's built by experience, and age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. His bravery was something he inherited from his parents. His success in defeating You Know Who was, however, completely his willpower and presence of mind as well as magnanimous courage. He wasn't afraid to ask for help, and professor Omkar and Bhakti did their best to help him.   

Harsh, Ronak and Sara were applauded for their victory, and the entire magical world was fearless once again. And as Peeves would have said: "We did it! We bashed them, wee Potter's the one! And Voldy's gone moldy, so now let's have fun!"  

Based on the theme of Harry Potter, this story's motive was to make you experience the Magical World and see what you would have done in similar cases.
